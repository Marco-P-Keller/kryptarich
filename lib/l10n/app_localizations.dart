/// Applications need to include `AppLocalizations.delegate()` in their app's
/// `localizationDelegates` list, and the locales they support in the app's
/// `supportedLocales` list. For example:
///
/// ```dart
/// import 'l10n/app_localizations.dart';
///

///   localizationsDelegates: AppLocalizations.localizationsDelegates,
///   supportedLocales: AppLocalizations.supportedLocales,
///   home: MyApplicationHome(),

///
/// ## Update pubspec.yaml
///
/// Please make sure to update your pubspec.yaml to include the following
/// packages:
///
/// ```yaml
/// dependencies:
///   # Internationalization support.
///   flutter_localizations:
///     sdk: flutter
///   intl: any # Use the pinned version from flutter_localizations
///
///   # Rest of dependencies
/// ```

/// ## iOS Applications
///
/// iOS applications define key application metadata, including supported
/// locales, in an Info.plist file that is built into the application bundle.
/// To configure the locales supported by your app, you’ll need to edit this
/// file.
///
/// First, open your project’s ios/Runner.xcworkspace Xcode workspace file.
/// Then, in the Project Navigator, open the Info.plist file under the Runner
/// project’s Runner folder.
///
/// Next, select the Information Property List item, select Add Item from the
/// Editor menu, then select Localizations from the pop-up menu.
///
/// Select and expand the newly-created Localizations item then, for each
/// locale your application supports, add a new item and select the locale
/// you wish to add from the pop-up menu in the Value field. This list should
/// be consistent with the languages listed in the AppLocalizations.supportedLocales
/// property.

What data is collected?\nKrypta collects as little data as is technically possible:\n• Anonymous Firebase ID (no email, no name, no phone number)\n• Public encryption key (X25519)\n• FCM push token (for notifications)\n\n3. Encryption\nAll messages are end-to-end encrypted (Signal protocol: X3DH + Double Ratchet). At no point does the server have access to the plaintext of your messages. Encryption: XChaCha20-Poly1305. Password hashing: Argon2id.\n\n4. Data storage\n• Messages are stored only on your device (encrypted)\n• The server acts solely as a temporary relay — messages are deleted after delivery\n• Keys are stored in the iOS Keychain / Android Keystore\n\n5. No trackers\nKrypta contains no analytics tools, no advertising and no trackers (0 of 432 known trackers).\n\n6. Data sharing\nNo personal data is passed on to third parties. Google Firebase is used as the infrastructure provider (anonymous authentication and push notifications).\n\n7. Data deletion\nYou can irreversibly delete all of your data at any time:\n• In the settings via \"Delete everything\"\n• By entering the delete code in the calculator\nThis destroys all local data, keys and server-side data.\n\n8. Your rights (GDPR)\nYou have the right to access, rectification, erasure and data portability. Contact us at: https://connexa-gmbh.ch\n\n9. Changes\nThis privacy policy may be updated.
