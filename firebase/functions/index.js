/**
 * Krypta Chat - Firebase Cloud Functions
 *
 * These functions handle server-side message lifecycle:
 * 1. Push notification triggers - notify recipient of new messages
 * 2. Message TTL cleanup - auto-delete messages after 24h
 *
 * SECURITY: The server NEVER has access to plaintext messages.
 * All payloads are encrypted ciphertext. The server is a dumb relay.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * RUNTIME: these are still 1st-gen functions, deliberately.
 *
 * Node 18 was decommissioned by Google, so the previous configuration could
 * not be deployed at all. Runtime is now nodejs22 (firebase.json +
 * package.json engines), on firebase-functions v6 with the v1 API imported
 * explicitly.
 *
 * Moving to 2nd-gen (`firebase-functions/v2`, onDocumentCreated / onSchedule)
 * is the better long-term shape, but it is NOT a drop-in: a function already
 * deployed as 1st-gen cannot be converted in place — it has to be deleted and
 * recreated under the same name, which drops events in between. Since nobody
 * here can see the deployed state of `kryptaecc`, that migration is left as a
 * deliberate, separate step. See docs/FIREBASE_FUNCTIONS.md.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * Wording of the push alert that lands on the lock screen.
 *
 * iOS renders it under the app name, which since d62998f is the product name
 * and no longer a calculator alias — today "Krypta Chat":
 *
 *     KRYPTA CHAT
 *     Du hast eine neue Nachricht erhalten
 *
 * Daniel asked for this wording, replacing the neutral "Tippen zum Oeffnen".
 * What it gives up: a glance at the lock screen now reveals THAT something
 * arrived, not merely that the app wants attention. Under a display name
 * already reading "Krypta Chat" that is a small step. On Android the label is
 * still "Calc", so there it costs more.
 *
 * Never a sender, never content, never a preview. Those would have to travel
 * through FCM, which Google logs.
 *
 * Deliberately no `title`: iOS already shows the app name above the body.
 *
 * ONE text for both cases, and the server could not do better. A contact
 * request is an ordinary inbox document; the `_rq` marker sits inside the
 * ciphertext. Writing "Du hast eine Anfrage erhalten" would require the sender
 * to attach a plaintext flag, telling Firebase exactly when a new connection
 * between two accounts is formed. Telling the two apart belongs in an iOS
 * Notification Service Extension that decrypts on the device; that needs a new
 * Xcode target and a Mac.
 *
 * Not localized. Doing that properly needs APNs `loc-key` plus a
 * Localizable.strings in every .lproj, and each of those has to be wired into
 * the Xcode project - not something to do blind without a Mac. All current
 * users are German-speaking, so German is the honest default rather than a
 * half-done mechanism. If the user base widens, localize it properly instead
 * of guessing server-side.
 *
 * Stricter alternative, if the cover matters more than being notified at all:
 * drop `notification` entirely and send a data-only push. The app already
 * fetches through lib/security/transport/privacy_polling.dart, so no message
 * would be lost - the user simply would not learn about it until they open
 * the app. See docs/FIREBASE_FUNCTIONS.md.
